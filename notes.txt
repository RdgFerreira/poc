Copilot performs better when the solution is suggested throughout logic and data processing methods instead of one main function

Copilot struggles with higher order and complex problem logic described with natural language

Copilot captura bem as maneiras de resolver os problemas a partir do contexto de problemas anteriores

Copilot chat produces more complex and detailed solutions with more complex explanations, using the whole problem description as context

Copilot chat performs better when asking in the same language as the problem description

Copilot struggles with capturing small but key problem details in the implementation

Copilot stuggles with spacial reasoning

Copilot produces better solutions with a step by step functional logic approach instead of providing the whole solution in one function

Copilot usually suggests solutions that exceeds time and memory constraints when facing intense math and number processing problems

Copilot struggles with complex string parsing and decoding

Copilot solutions converges faster with higher difficulty problems

Copilot can infer which algorithm to use in more complex problem categories, but struggles with executions

Copilot is more prone to runtime errors when there is a big suggestion
